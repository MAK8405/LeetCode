    "### LeetCode 392. Is Subsequence\n",

    "[https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.  \n",
    "For example, `\"ace\"` is a subsequence of `\"abcde\"`, while `\"aec\"` is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`s = \"abc\"`, `t = \"ahbgdc\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`true`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The characters `a`, `b`, `c` appear in `t` in the same order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`s = \"axc\"`, `t = \"ahbgdc\"`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`false`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The characters `a` and `c` appear in `t`, but `x` does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**  \n",
    "- `0 <= s.length <= 100`  \n",
    "- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`  \n",
    "- `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Follow-up:**  \n",
    "Suppose there are lots of incoming strings `s`, say `s1, s2, ..., sk` where `k >= 10^9`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. How would you change your code?  \n"
