    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the number with the value closest to 0 in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The distance from -4 to 0 is `|-4| = 4`.  \n",
    "The distance from -2 to 0 is `|-2| = 2`.  \n",
    "The distance from 1 to 0 is `|1| = 1`.  \n",
    "The distance from 4 to 0 is `|4| = 4`.  \n",
    "The distance from 8 to 0 is `|8| = 8`.  \n",
    "Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`1`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.\n",
