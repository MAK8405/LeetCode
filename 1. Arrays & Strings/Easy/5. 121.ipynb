    "**Problem Statement:**  \n",
    "You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "`5`  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6 - 1 = 5.  \n",
    "Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.\n",

    "**Output:**  \n",

    "In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.\n",
